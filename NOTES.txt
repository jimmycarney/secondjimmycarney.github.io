Creating local server for development:
>open terminal
>cd into directory containing index.html file
>run "py -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" or "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000"
>open localhost:8000 in a browser

Creating new git repository:
>Create repository on github website
>open terminal
>cd into folder where you want to store the project
>run "git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>"
>cd into <repository> (index.html is the file that will be hosted)

Add, commit, and push git changes:
>git add --all
>git commit -m "Initial commit"
>git push -u origin master

Hosting a site on github:
>Create a new repository on github named <username>.github.io
>>open terminal
>cd into folder where you want to store the project
>run "git clone https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io"
>cd into <username>.github.io (index.html is the file that will be hosted)
>add, commit, and push git changes
	>have to commit files more than once to get them to actually work

Using an API:
>Create an http request object (new XMLHttpRequest())
>Use the http request object to perform a GET request on the desired URL
	>This doesn't work for some sites because they restrict access to APIs
		>Results in access control error
>See the httpGetAsync function for an example
